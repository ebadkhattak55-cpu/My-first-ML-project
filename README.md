I am pleased to share the completion of my Machine Learning project where I developed a robust system for Car Invoice Price Prediction. This initiative showcases my ability to implement predictive analytics models from data ingestion through to interactive deployment.

Project Scope & Execution:

Objective: To accurately forecast the dealer's Invoice price based on key continuous vehicle attributes, providing a reliable baseline for price discovery.

Methodology:

Data Preparation: Implemented critical data preprocessing steps, including median imputation to address missing values in the Cylinders feature, and employed Label Encoding on categorical car features (Make, Model, Type, etc.) to understand their numerical representation before training.

Model Training: A Linear Regression model was selected and trained using influential continuous features such as MSRP, Engine Size, Horsepower, MPG, and dimensions (Weight, Wheelbase, Length).

Validation: The model was rigorously evaluated against a separate test set to ensure strong generalization and predictive fidelity.

Deployment (MLOps): Successfully integrated the trained model into a functional, user-friendly web interface using Gradio. This tool allows users to input car specifications and receive instant invoice price predictions, demonstrating proficiency in MLOps and practical application delivery.

Core Technologies Used:

Modeling: Python, Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, LabelEncoder)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Gradio

This project solidifies my expertise in regression modeling and end-to-end ML solution development.
